These are pre-designed Tophat PDF Files for easy cutting on Laser cutters (I use a laser cutter that wants PDF or SVG).

The files are based off the drawings from the official Voron 0.2 repository drawings, found here.

There are two versions:

* 100mm (91mm sides) - this is for tophats with 100mm extrusions.
* 80mm (71mm sides) - this is for tophats with 80mm extrusions.
