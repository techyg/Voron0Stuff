This repository is for all the Siboor v2 kit items that I am either changing/remixing, or noting. The goal of this is to help other Siboor V02 builders.

Modified Parts for Siboor Extrusions (MakerBeam XL)

* Siboor-M2_Nut_Adapter_Rotated_x5 - remixed nut carriers that will fit the Siboor MakerBeam XL extrusions. (height reduced and width slightly reduced). 
Remixed from Voron 0.2 STL repository.

Instructions: print with .1 layer for first layer to improve stiffness. The layer height is only .2 for the bottom, otherwise the nuts won't fit.

Note: THIS IS A VERY TIGHT FIT. The hex nuts included with the SIBOOR kit are approximately 2mm-2.2mm thick. Unforunately, that leaves very little room for plastic No Drop nuts. My remix below only has a .2mm thickness where the nut sits, which means they are really easy to break. I ran into issues and in some cases I had hex nuts that were too thick and these wouldn't work. 

* Siboor-V02_HexNut_1515.stl - intended to fit the included MakerBeam XL extrusions. 
Remixed from here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Zen3D/V0_1515_T-nut/MakerBeam

As an alternative, you can purchase standard DIN 562 square nuts (1.8mm) and use my square no drop nut mod. This will fit much easier and be a lot less frustration putting together.
