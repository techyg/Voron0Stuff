This repository is for all the Siboor v2 kit things so I can keep track of it.

* Siboor_V02_HexNut_1515.stl - intended to fit the included MakerBeam XL extrusions. 
Remixed from here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Zen3D/V0_1515_T-nut/MakerBeam

Print with .1 layer for first layer to improve stiffness. The layer height is only .2 for the bottom, otherwise the nuts won't fit.
